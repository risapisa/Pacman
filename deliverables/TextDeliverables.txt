Task M7:
1.I think that the refactorings I made to the Pacman project improved the
code immensely, because they made the code easier to read and so that certain
methods didn't continually repeat themselves over and over again. For example,
the methods in TrackerMonster, RandomMonster, and Pacman overlapped so much
that it almost didn't make sense for them not to be in a superclass together.

2. The primary goals of performing refactoring in a project are to preserve
the code's behavior while improving attributes of the software, such as
readability, maintainability, or the design of the system.
